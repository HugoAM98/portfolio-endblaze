# Enblaze portfolio
This portfolio was created for my friend endblaze. Developed in pure JS. A videogame developer portfolio on one page.

It consists of a simple navigation bar with 3 buttons that dynamically change the content of the page. 
The initial container displays the contact information. 
The projects button shows a series of videos of each project made with the links. 
The CV button shows academic information, knowledge in the most outstanding technologies and work experience. 
In addition to a final link to download the cv pdf format. 
The Know Me button displays a brief personal description of the developer.
